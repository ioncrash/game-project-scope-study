-   The data structure you plan to use.

I plan to mirror the api's data structure, in which the game and users are objects, and the board is an array of strings.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS

An array of strings. I plan to test win states by making more arrays with solutions to check

-   How you plan to approach this project.

I plan to get all the basic functionality first, and then add bonus functionality and maybe one or two extras if there's time.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.

As a player, I want to find my friends so that I can play against them.
As a player, I want to look up my past games so that I can see ending game boards.
As a player, I want to change my password so that I can keep my exboyfriend out of my account.
As a player, I want to sign in and out so that my new games are added to my history.

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.

I plan to have folers for different things -- game logic, account settings and signing in and out

-   What creative spin will you add to your project?

If there's time, I want to add features like a forfeit button and some creative images

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?

I plan to git add and commit every time I write a few lines of code that work.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?

Yes, I think I'll have time to do the "watch" bonus, if not more.
